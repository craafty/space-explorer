#### Life-Sized Solar System
- **Four celestial bodies** with real-world measurements:
  - **Sun**: 696,340,000 meters radius (696,340 km)
  - **Earth**: 6,371,000 meters radius at 149.6 million km from Sun
  - **Moon**: 1,737,100 meters radius at 384,400 km from Earth  
  - **Mars**: 3,389,000 meters radius at 227.9 million km from Sun
- **Authentic distances** - 1 AU = 149,597,870,700 meters
- **Human scale reference** - Player starts 1.7 meters tall on Earth's surface

#### Planet Rendering - Cube Sphere with LOD
- **Cube sphere geometry** - 6 cube faces projected to sphere coordinates
- **Quadtree-based Level of Detail (LOD)** system handling massive scale differences
- **Distance-based subdivision** - adapts from human scale to planetary scale
- **Seamless face transitions** between cube sphere faces
- **Dynamic mesh generation** with vertex/index buffer management
- **Real-time mesh updates** based on camera position
- **Individual planet materials** - Blue Earth, Gray Moon, Red Mars, Yellow Sun

#### Rendering Pipeline
- **Phong lighting model** with ambient, diffuse, and specular components
- **Massive rendering distances** - 1 trillion meter far plane for solar system scale
- **Dynamic vertex array objects (VAO)** for efficient rendering
- **Proper depth testing** and back-face culling
- **Wireframe mode toggle** for debugging LOD system

#### ImGui Debug Interface
- **Real-time solar system statistics**:
  - Total triangle/node counts across all planets
  - Individual planet information with real distances in km
  - Camera position in space coordinates
  - FPS and performance monitoring
- **Interactive planet navigation** - "Go to [Planet]" buttons
- **Wireframe toggle checkbox** for instant LOD visualization
- **Mouse mode indicator** showing current input state
- **Complete control reference** built into interface

### 🎮 Controls
- **TAB** - Toggle UI visibility
- **WASD** - Move forward/backward/left/right
- **Space** - Move up
- **C** - Move down
- **Mouse** - Look around (always active unless UI captures mouse)
- **Scroll wheel** - Zoom in/out
- **F** - Toggle wireframe mode
- **Ctrl** - Space travel speed (100,000x boost)
- **Shift+Ctrl** - Interplanetary speed (1 billion x boost - faster than light!)
- **Escape** - Exit game

### 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

#### Cube Sphere LOD Algorithm
- **6 cube faces** each with independent quadtree subdivision
- **Distance threshold** of 0.1 for subdivision decisions
- **Maximum LOD level** of 6 to prevent infinite subdivision
- **Resolution scaling** - base resolution 16, halved each level
- **Sphere projection** using normalization of cube coordinates

#### Key Classes
- **Engine**: Main application loop, input handling, rendering coordination
- **Camera**: View matrix calculation, movement processing
- **CubeSphere**: Planet geometry with LOD management
- **QuadNode**: Individual quadtree nodes with subdivision logic
- **ShaderManager**: Shader compilation and loading utilities

#### Performance Characteristics
- **Dynamic triangle count**: Ranges from ~1K to ~50K+ triangles based on distance
- **Efficient culling**: Only visible/relevant nodes are processed
- **Memory management**: Automatic cleanup of subdivision levels
- **60 FPS target**: Debug info updates once per second

### 🎯 Next Steps for Solar System Goal

#### Immediate Enhancements
1. **Multiple planets** - Add Mars, Moon, etc. with different scales
2. **Procedural terrain** - Height maps and surface detail generation
3. **Physics system** - Gravity, orbital mechanics, spacecraft dynamics
4. **Atmospheric rendering** - Scattering effects for more realistic planets

#### Long-term Features
1. **Realistic scale** - Implement actual solar system distances and sizes
2. **Time acceleration** - Speed up travel between planets
3. **Spacecraft mechanics** - Thrust, fuel, orbital insertion
4. **Multiple star systems** - Expand beyond our solar system

### 🐛 Known Issues
- Application requires graphics context (won't run headless)
- Console debug output may be verbose during movement
- Wireframe mode affects entire scene (no per-object toggle)

### 🏗️ Build Instructions
```bash
cd /home/lain/Dev/space
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make -j$(nproc)
```

### 🚀 Run Instructions
```bash
cd /home/lain/Dev/space/build/bin
./SpaceExplorer
```

### 📦 Dependencies

### 💡 Development Notes
- LOD system works best when testing at various distances
- Wireframe mode clearly shows triangle density adaptation
- Camera distance of 2-10 units shows good LOD variation
- Speed boost (Ctrl) useful for quickly testing different distances
- Console output provides real-time feedback on LOD performance
